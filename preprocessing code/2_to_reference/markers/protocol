Start recording (for pupil labs and EyeRecToo)

1) Calibration (system dependent). Check accuracy before starting the recording
(gaze should be within black of corner gaze markers). Recalibrate if needed, up
to three times. Then run with it regardless.
Start recording (for Tobii and SMI)

2) Validation (look at 9 targets from upper left to lower right)

3) Baseline (10 s): the participant standing still and gazing at the central
marker

4) Vowels (10 s): Swedish vowels (AOUÅ EIYÄÖ). x3

5) Eyebrows (10 s): raise both eye browns repeatedly (1 Hz)

6) Glasses movement: stare at the central marker while moving the glasses (about
1-2 cm)

Horizontal (10 s) (move glasses in x-axis)
Vertical (10 s) (move the glasses in y-axis)
Depth (10 s) (move the glasses in z-axis)
The exact range of movements was not defined exactly, but the eye corners and
pupil were always in picture.

7) Validation (look at 9 targets from upper left to lower right). Ask the
subject to put the glasses in the same position as in step 1).
